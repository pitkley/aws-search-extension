You create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want (like Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon RDS DB instances), and AWS CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you. You don't need to individually create and configure AWS resources and figure out what's dependent on what; AWS CloudFormation handles all of that. The following scenarios demonstrate how AWS CloudFormation can help."],
  "Why use AWS CloudFormation Designer?":["working-with-templates-cfn-designer-why", "AWS CloudFormation Designer (Designer) provides the following benefits: it allows you to see graphic representations of the resources in your template, it simplifies template authoring, and it simplifies template editing."],

  "Working with AWS CloudFormation StackSets":["what-is-cfnstacksets", "AWS CloudFormation StackSets extends the functionality of stacks by enabling you to create, update, or delete stacks across multiple accounts and regions with a single operation. Using an administrator account, you define and manage an AWS CloudFormation template, and use the template as the basis for provisioning stacks into selected target accounts across specified regions."],
  "Working with AWS CloudFormation templates":["template-guide", "To provision and configure your stack resources, you must understand AWS CloudFormation templates, which are formatted text files in JSON or YAML. These templates describe the resources that you want to provision in your AWS CloudFormation stacks. You can use AWS CloudFormation Designer or any text editor to create and save templates. For information about the structure and syntax of a template, see [Template anatomy](template-anatomy.md)."],

  "Working with nested stacks":["using-cfn-nested-stacks", "*Nested stacks* are stacks created as part of other stacks. You create a nested stack within another stack by using the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-stack.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-stack.html) resource."],
  "Working with stacks":["stacks", "A stack is a collection of AWS resources that you can manage as a single unit. In other words, you can create, update, or delete a collection of resources by creating, updating, or deleting stacks. All the resources in a stack are defined by the stack's AWS CloudFormation template. A stack, for instance, can include all the resources required to run a web application, such as a web server, a database, and networking rules. If you no longer require that web application, you can simply delete the stack, and all of its related resources are deleted."],
