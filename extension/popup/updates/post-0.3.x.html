    <h2>Changes</h2>

        <h3><span style="color: red;">VERY IMPORTANT!</span> Keyword changed from <code>aws</code> to <code>ase</code></h3>
        <p>
            After some more use of the extension it became evident that using <code>aws</code> as
            the search keyword was suboptimal. If you use your browser's omnibox for regular web
            searches, searching for anything related to AWS most likely will have you type
            <code>aws</code> followed by a space, which triggers the extension, making searching the
            web for AWS content very inconvenient.
        </p>
        <p>
            To circumvent this problem, this update changes the keyword to <code>ase</code>, short
            for "AWS search extension." While it is not quite as intuitive, it has the massive
            advantage of not overlapping with the regular search-term <em>aws</em>, while still
            retaining most of the advantages that the <code>aws</code> keyword had:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is as short with only 3 characters in length.</li>
            <li>
                It is as easy to type: the characters are all in the left cluster of the keyboard
                for QWERTY, QWERTZ, and AZERTY keyboard layouts, and they are in the home row for
                Dvorak.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h3>Default search and query prefixes changed</h3>
        <p>
            Previously, any non-prefixed search-term would automatically search in the AWS
            CloudFormation documentation. Now it will search through the AWS API references instead,
            since this is the more likely use-case of people using the extension.
        </p>
        <p>
            Searching for AWS CloudFormation resources is still possible, of course. You can
            trigger a search for AWS CloudFormation resources either by prefixing your query with a
            colon <code>:</code>, or by including two colons <code>::</code> somewhere in your
            search-term.
        </p>
        <p>
            In other words, both of the following search-terms will show you results from the AWS
            CloudFormation documentation:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>a::e::instance</code> will match because it has two consecutive colons in the
                query. It should show <code>AWS::EC2::Instance</code> as the first result.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>:findinmap</code> will match because it starts with a colon. It should show
                <code>Fn::FindInMap</code> as the first result.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The following table summarizes all the queries that are now valid:
        </p>
        <table>
            <thead>
            <tr>
                <td>Prefix</td>
                <td>Description</td>
            </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><em>(no prefix)</em> or <code>/</code></td>
                <td>Search all API references</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>&lt;service&gt;/</code></td>
                <td>Search the API references for the matching services.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>@</code></td>
                <td>Search all aws-cli references</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>&lt;service&gt;@</code></td>
                <td>Search the aws-cli references for the matching services.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>:</code> <em>(or <code>::</code> anywhere in the query)</em></td>
                <td>Search the AWS CloudFormation documentation</td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h3>Automatic index updates are now enabled by default</h3>
        <p>
            In previous versions of the AWS search extension, automatic updates of the bundled
            indices were disabled by default, although you could always enable them in the
            extension's configuration. Starting with version 1.0.0, automatic updates are now
            enabled by default!
        </p>
        <p>
            You can see and update your current configuration here:
        </p>
        <table style="border: 1px solid black; margin: auto; width: 60%;">
            <colgroup>
                <col span="1" style="width: 80%;">
                <col span="1" style="width: 20%;">
            </colgroup>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <div class="tooltip">
                        <label for="autoUpdateCheckbox">
                            Enable automatic index updates
                            &#9432;
                        </label>
                        <span class="text">
                            When enabled, the extension will regularly (by default once a day)
                            retrieve the latest indices automatically. The indices are retrieved
                            from GitHub via
                            <code>raw.githubusercontent.com/pitkley/aws-search-extension</code>.
                        </span>
                    </div>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <input type="checkbox" id="autoUpdateCheckbox"/>
                </td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>
            This setting <b>is remembered</b> when the extension is updated, i.e. you do not have to
            disable the automatic index updates on every extension update if you don't want them to
            be enabled.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>
                Please note that this was done to improve the experience and to reduce confusion for
                new users. You can still disable the automatic updates in the configuration or
                directly above. Please also note that this does not change the extension's stance on
                your privacy: getting updated indices is still the only time the extension performs
                any requests on your behalf; no data is collected at any given point!

        <h3>Remove of unnecessary permission</h3>
        <p>
            If you installed the AWS search extension previously, you might have been asked to allow
            the extension to "Read your browsing history" or "Access browser tabs". The only
            tab-access AWS search extension has ever needed was to open a URL in the current tab,
            which does not require the permission that would also allow for reading browsing history
            or interact with all tabs.
        </p>
        <p>
            As of version 1.0.1 this permission is no longer requested!
        </p>

    <h2>Further information</h2>
    <article>
        <p>
            AWS search extension is a browser-extension compatible with Google Chrome, Mozilla
            Firefox and Microsoft Edge (and probably most Chromium-based browsers). It provides
            search results for AWS API references and the AWS CloudFormation reference, and opens
            the official AWS documentation page when you select an item by pressing Enter.
