    <h1>AWS search extension - Updated</h1>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <article>
        <h3><span style="color: red;">VERY IMPORTANT!</span> Keyword changed from <code>aws</code> to <code>ase</code></h3>
        <p>
            After some more use of the extension it became evident that using <code>aws</code> as
            the search keyword was suboptimal. If you use your browser's omnibox for regular web
            searches, searching for anything related to AWS most likely will have you type
            <code>aws</code> followed by a space, which triggers the extension, making searching the
            web for AWS content very inconvenient.
        </p>
        <p>
            To circumvent this problem, this update changes the keyword to <code>ase</code>, short
            for "AWS search extension." While it is not quite as intuitive, it has the massive
            advantage of not overlapping with the regular search-term <em>aws</em>, while still
            retaining most of the advantages that the <code>aws</code> keyword had:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is as short with only 3 characters in length.</li>
            <li>
                It is as easy to type: the characters are all in the left cluster of the keyboard
                for QWERTY, QWERTZ, and AZERTY keyboard layouts, and they are in the home row for
                Dvorak.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h3>Default search and query prefixes changed</h3>
        <p>
            Previously, any non-prefixed search-term would automatically search in the AWS
            CloudFormation documentation. Now it will search through the AWS API references instead,
            since this is the more likely use-case of people using the extension.
        </p>
        <p>
            Searching for AWS CloudFormation resources is still possible, of course. You can
            trigger a search for AWS CloudFormation resources either by prefixing your query with a
            colon <code>:</code>, or by including two colons <code>::</code> somewhere in your
            search-term.
        </p>
        <p>
            In other words, both of the following search-terms will show you results from the AWS
            CloudFormation documentation:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>a::e::instance</code> will match because it has to consecutive colons in the
                query. It should show <code>AWS::EC2::Instance</code> as the first result.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>:findinmap</code> will match because it starts with a colon. It should show
                <code>Fn::FindInMap</code> as the first result.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The following table summarizes all the queries that are now valid:
        </p>
        <table>
            <thead>
            <tr>
                <td>Prefix</td>
                <td>Description</td>
            </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><em>(no prefix)</em> or <code>/</code></td>
                <td>Search all API references</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>&lt;service&gt;/</code></td>
                <td>Search the API references for the matching services.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>@</code></td>
                <td>Search all aws-cli references</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>&lt;service&gt;@</code></td>
                <td>Search the aws-cli references for the matching services.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>:</code> <em>(or <code>::</code> anywhere in the query)</em></td>
                <td>Search the AWS CloudFormation documentation</td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

    <h2>Further information</h2>
    <article>
        <p>
            AWS search extension is a browser-extension compatible with Google Chrome, Mozilla
            Firefox and Microsoft Edge (and probably most Chromium-based browsers). It provides
            search results for AWS API references and the AWS CloudFormation reference, and opens
            the official AWS documentation page when you select an item by pressing Enter.
