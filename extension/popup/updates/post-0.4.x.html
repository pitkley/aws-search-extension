    <h1>AWS search extension - Updated</h1>
</header>
<section>
    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <article>
        <h3>Automatic index updates are now enabled by default</h3>
        <p>
            In previous versions of the AWS search extension, automatic updates of the bundled
            indices were disabled by default, although you could always enable them in the
            extension's configuration. Starting with version 1.0.0, automatic updates are now
            enabled by default!
        </p>
        <p>
            You can see and update your current configuration here:
        </p>
        <table style="border: 1px solid black; margin: auto; width: 60%;">
            <colgroup>
                <col span="1" style="width: 80%;">
                <col span="1" style="width: 20%;">
            </colgroup>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <div class="tooltip">
                        <label for="autoUpdateCheckbox">
                            Enable automatic index updates
                            &#9432;
                        </label>
                        <span class="text">
                            When enabled, the extension will regularly (by default once a day)
                            retrieve the latest indices automatically. The indices are retrieved
                            from GitHub via
                            <code>raw.githubusercontent.com/pitkley/aws-search-extension</code>.
                        </span>
                    </div>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <input type="checkbox" id="autoUpdateCheckbox"/>
                </td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>
            This setting <b>is remembered</b> when the extension is updated, i.e. you do not have to
            disable the automatic index updates on every extension update if you don't want them to
            be enabled.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>
                Please note that this was done to improve the experience and to reduce confusion for
                new users. You can still disable the automatic updates in the configuration or
                directly above. Please also note that this does not change the extension's stance on
                your privacy: getting updated indices is still the only time the extension performs
                any requests on your behalf; no data is collected at any given point!

        <h3>Added support for AWS SAM template-resources and CLI docs</h3>
        <p>
            Searches for AWS CloudFormation resources now also yield AWS SAM resources (such as
            <code>AWS::Serverless:Function</code>) and the SAM-CLI docs (such as
            <code>sam init</code>). They are directly integrated with the CloudFormation
            search-results, so just using the same query types as for CloudFormation will now also
            show you the AWS SAM resources.
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>a::serverless::function</code> will show
                <code>AWS::Serverless::Function</code> as the first result.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>:sam</code> will show you the SAM-CLI documentation matches, such as
                <code>sam init</code>.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h3>Released as v1.0.0</h3>
        <p>
            Given the extension's maturity, AWS search extension has now been released as version
            1.0.0. There have been no breaking changes since version 0.4.x, and all other new
            features and changes are shown above.
        </p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h3>Remove of unnecessary permission</h3>
        <p>
            If you installed the AWS search extension previously, you might have been asked to allow
            the extension to "Read your browsing history" or "Access browser tabs". The only
            tab-access AWS search extension has ever needed was to open a URL in the current tab,
            which does not require the permission that would also allow for reading browsing history
            or interact with all tabs.
        </p>
        <p>
            As of version 1.0.1 this permission is no longer requested!
        </p>

        <p>
            AWS search extension is a browser-extension compatible with Google Chrome, Mozilla
            Firefox and Microsoft Edge (and probably most Chromium-based browsers). It provides
            search results for AWS API references and the AWS CloudFormation reference, and opens
            the official AWS documentation page when you select an item by pressing Enter.
